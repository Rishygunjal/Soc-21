To enjoy the gaps in the old stories and fill them in new ways.To make room for a multiplicity of narratives.To give voice to marginal/invisible/unjustly-treated characters.To raid the shared collective cultures we can all access. To celebrate that great gift: freedom of interpretationTo understand who we are and where we come from. We will look at some of the areas that are rich with possibility for creative retellings: mythologies, fairy tales, folktales.
